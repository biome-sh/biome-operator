# Standalone topology example

A topology describes the intended relationship between members within a Biome service group. Find out more about topologies in Biome in this [documentation](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/run-packages-topologies/).


## Workflow

Simply run:

  `kubectl create -f examples/standalone/biome.yml`.

This will deploy an instance of a redis Biome service.
